# Virtual Bank
This program is a virtual bank holding upto 10 accounts at the beginning. More accounts may be added using the new account prompt. 
The program holds 10 different bank accounts each including a name, SSN, account type, account balance, and whether the account is open or closed. 
Using the prompts on the menu one can deposit, withdraw, check the balance, open or close, delete, cash a check, or create a new account.
One can also check their transaction history with or without the receipts. 
The program uses multiple classes and subclasses. Polymorphism and inheritance are also utilized. Some custom exceptions are also present. 

A new user should first open an account. The program will ask you for certain inputs to create an account. 
Beyond that the program is self explanatory. You may deposit money, withdraw money, cash a check, search through your history etc.
